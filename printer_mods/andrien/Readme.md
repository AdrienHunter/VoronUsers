# Intellinet 19 inch network cabinet (15HE 77x57x60 black) Top Cover 

The enclosure is a perfect fit for an Voron 1.x (320x320x320 buildplate) type of printer, but smaller sizes will fit for sure too.
The 320'ish is the max size fit within this type of enclosure but manual cut outs are already needed using a cutting tool like Dremel.

At the lower floor of the enclosure I added 2 x 0,74 inch medium-density (heavy) fibreboard's to reduce the the printers top haviness due to the large / heavy aluminum cast plate.

All sides have been sound & heat insulated using 40mm glass wool material and aluminum heat insulation plus tape.
The top cover has been additionally added within an angle to the front, allowing the bowden to move freely.
Additionally two 80mm (SunAce) fans including carbon filter & HEPA H14 filter have been added within the top cover section.
Due to the Hepa H14 specs a high pressure fan is needed.
During normal operation, running at 15% duty cycle its still silent <22db.
